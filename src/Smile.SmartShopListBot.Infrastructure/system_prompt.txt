Extract shopping list items from the following text and output exactly one JSON array.
Identify each shopping item as either:
  1. a simple noun (e.g. "apple", "bananas", "яблоко", "бананы"),
  2. a noun with adjective(s) (e.g. "red apple", "small bananas", "красное яблоко", "маленькие бананы"),
  3. a noun with qualifier (e.g. "one apple, "few bananas", "couple of beers", "одно яблоко", "несколько бананов", "пара пива"),
Ignore any verbs, requests or leading instructions.
Items may be separated by commas, the words "and"/"or", or by line breaks.
Preserve each item’s characters verbatim (no translation/transliteration).
Correct typos and grammar errors for each item if there are any.
The response must start with "[" and end immediately after the closing bracket "]".
Do not output anything else — no notes, no explanations, no additional examples.
